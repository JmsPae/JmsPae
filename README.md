# James Pae

Enjoy me some computer graphics, though nowerdays GIS/Geospatial is what I'm usually up to.

- [GeoDistrib](https://github.com/JmsPae/GeoDistrib/) | Tool for distributing cell attributes/variables among contained features.
- [Historiska Indelningar](https://github.com/JmsPae/historiska-indelningar) | Historical Swedish administrative boundaries derived from SCB data.
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/JmsPae/Tracer) | A simple Raytracer written in GLSL for OpenGL.
- [Marcher](https://github.com/JmsPae/Marcher) | Experiments in Ray-Marching for my gymnasiearbete (final-year project of high-school).
